                <h3 class="title">How to do it</h3>
                
                <p>Stand with your feet together or hip-width apart. Ground down through the four corners of your feet. Roll your shoulders away from your ears, draw your shoulder blades down your back, and lift the crown of your head.

                    Engage your thighs, draw your belly button in, and lengthen up through the spine. Turn your palms facing the front of the room. Relax your jaw and unfurrow your brow. Breathe easy.</p>
                    <h3 class="title">Benifits</h3>
                    <p>It may seem like you’re, well, just standing there, but bear with us. This is the blueprint for all other poses. It promotes balance and directs your attention to the present moment.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="title">2. Chair Pose (Sanskrit: Utkatasana) </h2>
                    <img src="images/2.png" alt="">
                    <h3 class="title">How to do it</h3>
                    <p>Start in Mountain Pose. As you inhale, raise your arms, spread your fingers, and reach up through your fingertips. As you exhale, sit back and down as if sitting into a chair.

                        Shift your weight toward the heels and lengthen up through the spine. As you inhale, lift and lengthen through your arms. As you exhale, sit deeper into the pose.</p>
                        <h3 class="title">Benifits</h3>
                        <p>This heating standing pose (give it a minute, you’ll feel the burn) strengthens your legs, upper back, and shoulders. As a bonus, you’ll have an opportunity to practice patience as your thighs work hard. Just remember to breathe.</p>
                    
                        <h2 class="title">3. Down Dog on a chair (Sanskrit: Uttana shishosana)</h2>
                    <img src="images/3.png" alt="">
                    <h3 class="title">How to do it</h3>
                    <p>Place your hands on the back of a chair with palms shoulder-distance apart. Step your feet back until they align under hips, creating a right angle with your body, spine parallel with the floor.

                        Ground through your feet and lift through thighs. Reach hips away from hands to lengthen the sides of your torso. Firm your outer arms in and lengthen through the crown of your head.</p>
                        <h3 class="title">Benifits</h3>
                        <p>Downward-Facing Dog is the bread and butter of yoga, but it can be challenging for beginners.

                            This modification shares the same benefits as the classic pose — stretching the hamstrings, opening the shoulders, and creating length in the spine — without all the weight on your upper body.</p>
                        <h2 class="title">4. Downward-Facing Dog (Sanskrit: Adho Mukha Svanasana)</h2>
                    <img src="images/4.png" alt="">
                    <h3 class="title">How to do it</h3>
                    <p>From all fours, walk your hands 6 inches in front of you. Tuck your toes and lift your hips up and back to lengthen your spine. If your hamstrings are tight, keep your knees bent in order to bring your weight back into the legs.

                        Spread your fingers wide, press into your hands, and rotate your arms so that your biceps are facing toward one another. Press your thighs back toward the wall behind you.</p>
                        <h3 class="title">Benifits</h3>
                        <p>This classic pose opens your shoulders, lengthens your spine, and stretches your hamstrings. Since your head is below your heart, the mild inversion creates a calming effect.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="title">5. Warrior II (Sanskrit: Virabhadrasana II)</h2>
                    <img src="images/5.png" alt="">
                    <h3 class="title">How to do it</h3>
                    <p>Stand with feet wide, 3–4 feet apart. Shift your right heel out so your toes are pointing slightly inward. Turn your left foot out 90 degrees. Line up your left heel with the arch of your right foot.

                        Bend your left knee to a 90-degree angle, keeping the knee in line with the second toe to protect the knee joint. Stretch through your straight back leg and ground down into the back foot.
                        
                        On an inhale, bring arms to a T at shoulder height. Draw your shoulder blades down the back. Spread your fingers and keep palms facedown. Gaze over the front fingers. As you exhale, sink deeper into the stretch.</p>
                        <h3 class="title">Benifits</h3>
                        <p>A pose with “warrior” in its name may not sound very zen, but this standing pose can help calm and steady your mind. Tougher than it looks, it also strengthens your legs and ankles while increasing stamina.</p>
                        <h2 class="title">6. Triangle Pose (Sanskrit: Trikonasana)</h2>
                    <img src="images/6.png" alt="">
                    <h3 class="title">How to do it</h3>
                    <p>Stand with feet wide, 3–4 feet apart. Shift your right heel out so your toes are pointing slightly inward. Turn your left foot out 90 degrees. Line up your left heel with the arch of your right foot.

                        Keeping both legs straight, ground through your feet. Lift arms into a T at shoulder height. Reach forward with your front arm. When you can’t reach anymore, hinge at the front hip.
                        
                        Bring your front arm down to your shin, a foam block, or the ground. Lift your back arm up toward the sky and spread your fingers. Take your gaze down to the floor or up toward your lifted hand.</p>
                        <h3 class="title">Benifits</h3>
                        <p>While this pose can be challenging for those with tight muscles, it will help promote balance, stretch the hamstrings and inner thighs, and create a feeling of expansion in the body.</p>
                        <h2 class="title">7. Tree Pose (Sanskrit: Vrksasana)</h2>
                    <img src="images/7.png" alt="">
                    <h3 class="title">How to do it</h3>
                    <p>Start in Mountain Pose. Find a fixed point in front of you and stare at it to help you balance.

                        As you inhale, shift the weight into your left foot and lift your right foot an inch off the floor. Using your right hand, bring the foot to your shin or inner thigh. Avoid placing your foot directly on the knee.
                        
                        As you exhale, ground through the standing leg and lengthen through the crown of your head. Bring your palms to touch in front of your sternum into prayer hands.</p>
                        <h3 class="title">Benifits</h3>
                        <p>This pose helps improve concentration and your ability to balance by strengthening the arches of the feet and the outer hips.</p>
                        <h2 class="title">8. Bridge Pose (Sanskrit: Setu Bandha Sarvangasana)</h2>
                    <img src="images/8.png" alt="">
                    <h3 class="title">How to do it</h3>
                    <p>Lie faceup with knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and arms at your sides with palms facedown. Keep your feet parallel and hip-width apart, heels stacked under knees.

                        On an inhale, activate through the legs and the glutes. Press the floor away with your feet and lift the hips off the floor toward the sky.
                        
                        If your shoulders are tight and you want more leverage, try holding the sides of your yoga mat and lifting your hips. You may also wish to interlace your fingers underneath your “bridge” and shimmy your shoulders under the chest.
                        
                        When you’re ready to come down, lift your heels up and slowly lower your hips back to the ground, one vertebra at a time.</p>
                        <h3 class="title">Benifits</h3>
                        <p>This energizing backbend opens your chest and stretches your neck and spine. It can calm the mind, reduce anxiety, and help improve digestion.</p>
                        <h2 class="title">9. Bound Ankle Pose (Sanskrit: Baddha Konasana)</h2>
                    <img src="images/9.png" alt="">
                    <h3 class="title">How to do it</h3>
                    <p>Sitting on the floor, bend knees and open them out to the side like a book. Join the soles of your feet together while sitting upright.

                        Place fingertips on the floor directly behind you and lengthen up through the spine. You can also hold onto your ankles and hinge forward at the hips.
                        
                        Pro tip: If you’re feeling stiff, sit on the edge of a blanket to help your forward fold.</p>
                        <h3 class="title">Benifits</h3>
                        <p>You’ll give your inner thighs and groin a nice stretch, while the forward bend creates a calming, cooling effect.</p>
                        <h2 class="title">10. Seated Forward Fold (Sanskrit: Paschimottanasana)</h2>
                    <img src="images/10.png" alt="">
                    <h3 class="title">How to do it</h3>
                    <p>Sit and straighten your legs out in front of you, grounding your thighs into the floor. Hinge at the hips to elongate your torso over your thighs. Grab hold of the outer edges of your feet.

                        Pro tip: If your hamstrings are tight, grab a strap and loop it behind your feet. Use the leverage to bring your torso closer to your thighs. You can also sit on the edge of a blanket to help you fold forward.</p>
                        <h3 class="title">Benifits</h3>
                        <p>This feel-good fold elongates the back of your body, lengthens your spine, and stretches your hamstrings.</p>
                        <h2 class="title">11. Corpse Pose (Sanskrit: Savasana)</h2>
                    <img src="images/11.png" alt="">
                    <h3 class="title">How to do it</h3>
                    <p>Lie faceup, bringing your legs to the outer edges of your mat, like a starfish. Splay your feet out to the sides. Place arms along sides, palms facing up. Close your eyes and relax.</p>
                        <h3 class="title">Benifits</h3>
                        <p>Yep, it’s as simple as it sounds. Every yoga class includes Savasana, which relaxes the whole body and gives you space to absorb the benefits of the practice.</p>
                        <h2 class="title">12. Plank Pose (Sanskrit: Kumbhakasana)</h2>
                    <img src="images/12.png" alt="">
                    <h3 class="title">How to do it</h3>
                    <p>Start in Downward-Facing Dog. Shift forward so your shoulders are stacked over your wrists. Draw your navel in toward your spine and keep your hips from dropping.

                        Reach heels back as you lengthen the crown of your head forward. Ground down into hands, pushing the floor away beneath you. Lengthen through the arms and broaden your chest.</p>
                        <h3 class="title">Benifits</h3>
                        <p>Considered one of the best moves for core strength, Plank Pose strengthens your abdominals and promotes stability.</p>
                        <h2 class="title"> 13. Four-Limbed Staff Pose</h2>
                    <img src="images/13.png" alt="">
                    <h3 class="title">How to do it</h3>
                    <p>From Plank Pose, shift forward onto your tippy toes. Ground through your palms and broaden across the chest. Take an inhale.

                        On an exhale, bend your elbows to a 90-degree angle. Keep your thighs lifted toward the ceiling. Imagine stretching your tailbone toward your heels as you lengthen through the spine. Hold your elbows in line with the torso. Gaze forward.
                        
                        To come out of the pose, release your knees to the ground. You can also keep your knees lifted and lower down onto your stomach for an extra ab challenge. Another option is to lift up and back to a Downward-Facing Dog and relax.</p>
                        <h3 class="title">Benifits</h3>
                        <p>Chaturanga is a key part of Sun Salutations, which you’ll find in Hatha, Sivananda, Ashtanga, and Vinyasa yoga classes. It promotes core stability and strengthens your abdominals and triceps.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="title">14. Upward-Facing Dog (Sanskrit: Urdhva Mukha Svanasana)</h2>

                    <h3 class="title">How to do it</h3>
                    <p>Lie facedown on the floor. Bend elbows and place hands on the mat in line with lower ribs. Hug your elbows in line with your torso. Tuck your toes and take an inhale.

                        As you exhale, push the floor away like a push-up. Straighten your arms and broaden across the chest, hovering your hips a few inches above the floor at the same time.</p>
                        <h3 class="title">Benifits</h3>
                        <p>You’ll open up your chest and shoulders, while stretching the abdominals and hip flexors. This pose comes after chaturanga in a classic Sun Salutation.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="title"> 15. Half Moon Pose (Sanskrit:  Ardha Chandrasana)</h2>

                        Shift your weight onto your front foot and lift your back foot off the ground. Straighten out the front leg, keeping your front hand on the floor or on a block.
                        
                        Reach your back leg toward the wall behind you, foot flexed. Lift your back arm up toward the sky. Keep your gaze on the hand touching the ground.
                        
                        To come out of the pose, bend the front leg and slowly lower the lifted leg down toward the floor.</p>

                        On an inhale, lengthen through the spine and lift your arms up. Place your hands on your hips or lift them up in a V toward the ceiling. Rotate your torso toward the front of the room.</p>
